jai-imageio-core (standalone)
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Cosium/jai-imageio-core.svg?branch=1.3.0.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Cosium/jai-imageio-core)

NOTE: This is a fork of the
[original jai-imageio-core](https://java.net/projects/jai-imageio-core/)
(which is no longer maintained).


This project adds read/write support for the following file types to 
Java's [ImageIO](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html):
 
* wbmp
* bmp
* pcx
* pnm
* raw
* tiff
* gif (write)

The classes of this projects are not generally used directly, but through
the SPI plugin mechanism of ImageIO. See the 
[ImageIO guide](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/imageio/spec/imageio_guideTOC.fm.html)
for details.

This project is called 'standalone' as unlike the [original
jai-imageio-core](https://java.net/projects/jai-imageio-core/) 
it has removed dependencies to jai-core packages (`javax.media.jai`) and JPEG
2000 (`jj2000`).  This version also does not include the C
implementations from libJIIO, meaning that this version is platform independent
and fully redistributable under the 3-clause BSD license in
[LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) (and thus is Apache and GPL compatible).

JPEG 2000 support is available as an additional module 
[jai-imageio-jpeg2000](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-jpeg2000)
as it has a different (non-GPL compatible) license.


If you are not concerned about GPL compatibility or source code
availability, you might instead want to use
https://github.com/geosolutions-it/imageio-ext/ which is actively
maintained and extends the original imageio with many useful features,
but depends on the [binary distribution of jai\_core](
http://download.osgeo.org/webdav/geotools/javax/media/jai_core/1.1.3/).

[Github Pull Request](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core/pulls)
with any suggested improvements.

You can also raise an
[issue](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core/issues) - your stacktrace
